# README

This is my solution to the Codewars Kata [Counting Overlapping Events](https://www.codewars.com/kata/counting-overlapping-events/train/sql)

The challenge is to find the maximum number of simultaneous users of a service, using a table containing
visit records with an entry and exit timestamp.


# STYLISTIC CHOICES

Nothing major to report here.


# TESTS

I have relied on the Codewars tests, though details of what these comprise are not provided on the site.
